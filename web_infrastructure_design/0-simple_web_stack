COMPONENTS:

Server: Physical/virtual machine hosting all components
Domain Name: foobar.com - human-readable address translating to IP 8.8.8.8
DNS Record: www is a CNAME or A record pointing to 8.8.8.8
Web Server (Nginx): Handles HTTP requests, serves static content
Application Server: Executes business logic, processes dynamic content
Database (MySQL): Stores and manages persistent data
Communication: HTTP/HTTPS protocol over TCP/IP

ISSUES:

SPOF: Single server - if it fails, entire site goes down
Downtime: Deploying code requires restarting services
Cannot Scale: Single server cannot handle traffic spikes
