            MySQL Primary  <------>  MySQL Replica

WHY EACH ELEMENT:

Load Balancer: Distributes traffic across servers, eliminates single point of failure
Server 2: Redundancy and load distribution
MySQL Replica: Data backup and read scaling

LOAD BALANCER:

Algorithm: Round Robin - distributes requests sequentially across servers
Setup: Active-Active (both servers handle traffic simultaneously)
Active-Active: All servers process requests concurrently, max resource usage
Active-Passive: One active, others standby until failure occurs

DATABASE:

Primary-Replica: Primary handles writes, Replica syncs data and handles reads
Primary Node: Accepts write operations, replicates to Replica
Replica Node: Read-only copy, reduces Primary load, provides backup

ISSUES:

SPOF: Load balancer itself is single point of failure
Security: No firewall protection, no HTTPS encryption
No Monitoring: Cannot detect failures or performance issues
