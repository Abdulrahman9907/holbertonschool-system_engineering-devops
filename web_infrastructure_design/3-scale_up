WHY EACH ELEMENT:

Second Load Balancer: Eliminates LB as SPOF, high availability cluster
Separate Web Server: Optimized for static content, independent scaling
Separate App Servers: Scale application logic independently, isolated resources
Separate DB Server: Dedicated resources for database, better performance, independent scaling

BENEFITS:

- Component isolation allows independent scaling
- Web server can be optimized for static content delivery
- App servers can scale horizontally based on traffic
- Database gets dedicated resources without sharing CPU/memory
- Load balancer cluster provides redundancy
