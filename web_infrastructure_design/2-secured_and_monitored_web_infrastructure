                          (Sumologic)

WHY EACH ELEMENT:

Firewalls: Filter malicious traffic, protect against unauthorized access
SSL Certificate: Encrypts data in transit, protects user privacy
Monitoring Clients: Collect metrics, logs, detect issues

SECURITY & MONITORING:

Firewalls: Block unauthorized ports/IPs, prevent attacks
HTTPS: Encrypts HTTP traffic using SSL/TLS, prevents eavesdropping
Monitoring: Tracks performance, uptime, errors, alerts on issues
Data Collection: Agents send logs/metrics to central monitoring service
QPS Monitoring: Configure monitoring client to track Nginx access logs per second

ISSUES:

SSL Termination at Load Balancer: Traffic unencrypted between LB and servers
Single MySQL Writer: Write bottleneck, SPOF for data modifications
Identical Components: Resource waste, cannot optimize per component type
